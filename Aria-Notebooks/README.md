This repository contains 2 jupyter notebooks created for the internship:
AOP_Dataset_Visual_Analysis.ipynb focuses on visualising, extending and analysing the AOP as a whole. The statistical analyses have been performed here as well.
KE_Pathway_Visual_Analysis.ipynb visualises the logFC and P Values on the Key Event pathways of the AOP.

Additionally, all the linksets, dataset and styles used in the notebooks are available in the repository.
