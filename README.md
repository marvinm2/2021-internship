# 2021-internship code repository

This Github repository contains the code, datafiles, and output of the Bachelor Biomedical Sciences internships (2021) by Aria Jadhav and Stefan Raats. 

Both work on Jupyter notebooks to work with molecular Adverse Outcome Pathways of COVID-19 and _in vitro_ gene expression data. Using Py4cytoscape, the Jupyter notebooks forward commands to Cytoscape which is used for network creation, extending, and data visualisations.

- Aria's final files are here: [Aria-Notebooks](https://github.com/marvinm2/2021-internship/tree/main/Aria-Notebooks)
